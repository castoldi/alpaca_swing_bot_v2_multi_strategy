# Changelog

All notable changes to **Alpaca Swing Bot V2** are recorded here.
Format follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/); versioning is
semantic (`MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH`).

**Versioning model:**
- The canonical semantic version lives in the [`VERSION`](VERSION) file and is bumped
  manually (use `pwsh scripts/version.ps1 -Bump patch|minor|major`).
- Every commit is auto-tagged by the `post-commit` git hook as
  `v<version>+build<N>-<YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS>`, where `<N>` is the total commit count
  (auto-incrementing build number) and the datetime is the commit time.
- List the build history any time with `pwsh scripts/version.ps1 -Builds`.

## [Unreleased]

_Changes landed but not yet released under a new version number go here._

## [0.1.0] - 2026-06-13

First versioned release. Establishes the email/duplicate fixes and the
build-version + auto-tag workflow.

### Added
- **Versioning & build tags** — `VERSION` file, this `CHANGELOG.md`, a `post-commit`
  git hook (`scripts/git-hooks/post-commit`) that tags every commit
  `v<version>+build<N>-<datetime>`, and `scripts/version.ps1` to show/bump the
  version and list builds. Hook is installed via `core.hooksPath = scripts/git-hooks`.
- **Singleton process manager** — `scripts/manage.ps1` (`status`, `start-bot`,
  `stop-bot`, `restart-bot`, `start-dashboard`, `stop-dashboard`,
  `restart-dashboard`). Idempotent: refuses to spawn a duplicate when a healthy
  instance is already running; replaces dead/hung ones and sweeps orphans.
- **Runtime PID/heartbeat tracking** — `runtime.py`; the bot writes `run/bot.pid`,
  `run/bot.meta.json`, and a per-loop `run/bot.heartbeat` so health (alive **and**
  looping) can be detected. Dashboard PID/meta written by the manager.

### Fixed
- **Email flood** — two root causes eliminated:
  1. Duplicate `--loop` bots were running simultaneously, each emailing every 30 min.
     The manager now prevents duplicates.
  2. The "Qty 0" bug: with `dollars_per_trade=$200`, stocks priced >$200 (e.g. ARM)
     computed `qty=0`, fell through, and emailed "Qty 0" every loop while opening an
     unprotected position. Such entries are now skipped entirely (no order, no email).

### Changed
- High-priced stocks (`qty < 1`) are skipped instead of placed as bare notional
  orders. Raise `dollars_per_trade` in `config.py` to trade them with proper brackets.
- `CLAUDE.md` / `AGENTS.md` updated with the no-duplicate rule, PID-finding
  instructions, the health model, and the manager-based restart workflow.
